* Introduction
In general, there are two proposed methods for training the robot AI,
one with a human in the loop and one with only AI's bouncing data off
of each other. The game has two roles, the "human" and the "robot."

Due to the potential confusion of having the "human" be controlled by
either an actual person or an AI, for this document we shall refer to
the role giving instructions as the Commander and the role receiving
commands as the Worker.

From a high level, whatever system is put in for the Worker, it should
operate as a function that inputs:
- a list of blocks with their locations and visual information
- a command string from the Commander
- a 2D point the Commander pointed to
and outputs:
- a 2D point representing the block to pick up
- a 2D point representing where to drop the block
* Full Q-Learning
** System Design
The map will be broken down into a discrete number of cells. Each
square block will take up an odd number of cells, as will the
representation of the arm. The pointer will point to exactly one
cell. To pick up a block, the arm must contain the centermost cell of
a block. If there are multiple blocks underneath the arm, select the
one closest to the center.
** Worker Design
The Worker will be implemented using a Q-learning algorithm.
*** State
The state of the system will be made of:
- the current locations and visual details of all the blocks
- the current location of the Worker's arm
- the syntax tree of the last command from the Commander
- the location pointed to by the Commander
- whether a block is being currently held by the arm and the visual
  details of that block
*** Actions
The possible actions at any state (assuming that the action will not
take the arm out of bounds) will be:
- move north by one cell
- move east by one cell
- move south by one cell
- move west by one cell
- move north by ten cells
- move east by ten cells
- move south by ten cells
- move west by ten cells
- toggle arm (to grab / drop the block)
- flip arm (to flip blocks)
- stop

There are 10 possible actions from each state, leading to a rather
large explosion of possible states. The 10 cell movements were chosen
to give the algorithm a better chance of finding the exit each
** Training Phases
In order to get a basically trained AI to perform the job of the
Worker, an automated Commander will be created using data gathered
from the previous "Human as Worker" stage.

This has the great advantage of being extremely fast; without a human
in the loop, thousands of trials may be executed in the same time that
a human could issue a single instruction. Unfortunately, the only
system that can effectively mimic instructions from any potential user
is humans. If we only train with an AI Commander, the Worker may learn
only the subset of interactions that the AI Commander knows about, and
will be unable to handle more diverse and unexpected input.

To counter this, once the Worker is trained to a "passable" point,
fully automated learning will be switched off and the game will be
made available for humans to play as the Commander. Since the Worker
has been previously trained, the humans will produce much more
relevant data from their interactions with the Worker, as opposed to
if they were trying to talk to a non-responsive, untrained Worker.

**** Implementation of the AI Commander
During the previous "Human as Worker" phase, the system gathered lots
of data about how humans act as the Commander. Using these
interactions, we will assemble an AI Commander by patching together
different phrases (at random, when necessary).
*** TODO Human in the Loop
* Reduced Q-Learning
** System Design
This proposal follows the same layout as [[Full Q-Learning]], but it
attempts to handle the most significant hurdle to that method:
scale. With all of the possible statements that could be given by the
commander and how many different arrangements the board can have,
Q-Learning would have too many states to remember and would rarely
ever find itself in the same state.

Our improvements to this is twofold: reduce the language into
structure and reduce the precision of location of blocks.
*** Structural Language
In order to reduce the number of possible permuations that arise as
the result of natural language, and given the fairly restrictive
nature of the domain of many commands, the structure of the command
and its direct object are likely the most relevant pieces of
information about that command. Take these sentences with their
direct objects underlined, for example.

Move that /red block/ over here.
Place that /red block/ around there.
Set the /red block/ near there.

To us, all of these sentences are saying the same thing (assuming the
Commander is pointing to the same spot). If we only think about the
structure and the direct object, we're able to group these sentences
together into one shared state as well as distinguish between
sentences like the following.

Don't move the /red block/ over here.
Move the /blue block/ over here.
Move the /red block/ into that corner.

There are some obvious drawbacks to such a simplistic solution. For
starters, this won't be able to handle more complex sentences such as:

Move the /red block/ next to that yellow block.
Move /it/ a bit to the right.

These are significant, and a more useful way of reducing a sentence
may be useful.
*** Location of Blocks
In order to collapse the different possibilities of the locations of
the blocks, we reduce the state of the world into a k-d tree. The
state will only have a precise coordinate for the block it is closest
to, and after that it will have less and less detailed knowledge of
the precise locations of more distant blocks.

The reasoning behind this is that moving a single block a tiny bit,
especially when that block is irrelevant to the given command, would
completely ignore any gained knowledge of an otherwise identical
problem. If the locations of distant blocks are fuzzed, then small
changes in their location will not affect the remembered state nearly
as much.
* Neural Network
** System Design
Another option for mapping inputs to instructions is to use a neural network.
This method would allow for increased flexibility in the text input, as we would
not need to constrain the format in any way. It would, however, require us to
have a sizable data set before we are able to get meaningful results. This will
be difficult to do without either a significant time commitment or a large
number of people to help.
** Worker Design
*** Inputs
There are several possible ways we could provide inputs to our neural network,
with our most significant choices being in how we provide the blocks and point
locations from the Commander. One option is to fix the number of possible blocks
or to give a maximum possible number. This would be most likely to give good
results, but would provide constraints on the way the Worker views the outside
world. The other option is to use an LSTM or similar recurrent layer to allow
for variable length inputs. This would allow for an increase in flexibility, but
may decrease the performance of our network. Neither the set of input blocks nor
the points has any temporal locality, which is the usual use case of recurrent
networks. A "window" of blocks is not really something that makes sense.
*** Outputs
We also have a number of options for our neural network output. One option is to
set a discrete set of possible locations. The output to the neural network would
then be the index of the block to move, followed by the location to place the
block. Another option is to output two points. The first point would again refer
to a block, but instead of being an index we would consider the block closest to
the given point. The second point would then be the exact location to place it.
We could also consider the output to be a set of instructions for the final
robot. As an example, it could be the starting and final configurations for the
arm. However, this method would be much more difficult to gather data for, and
to test outside of the lab.
** Training Phases
Using neural networks would provide a similar set of trade offs as the other
methods. We will either need to spend a significant amount of time gathering
data or use generated data, which may not be varied enough to allow us to
eventually consider the entire English language. Similar to above, we would
likely proceed by training on generated data until our Worker is passable, then
allow access to human commanders who would be able to provide higher quality
data.
