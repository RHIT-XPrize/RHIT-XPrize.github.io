* RHIT-XPrize GitHub.io Page
Holds various documentation and presentations used for the RHIT-XPrize
project. See other projects under this organization if you're
interested.

This is mostly just being used as cloud storage to hold the
documentation and presentations we use. The index is a little rough
looking, but it's basically just a file selector, so it doesn't really
matter.
