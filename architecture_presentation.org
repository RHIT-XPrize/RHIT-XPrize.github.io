* Our Goal
- RHIT is participating in the IBM AI XPrize Competition in 2020!
- Robot that can understand and react to natural human interaction.
- Specifically working with the manipulation of blocks.
- Architect a system that can be easily used and extended by future
  teams.
** Current MVP
[[./MVP.png]]
** Final Goal
[[./sawyer.jpg]]
* Core Requirements
- Interfaces with ROS-Indigo.
- Easy to slot new components in and out in different combinations to
  facilitate rapid experimentation and development.
- Able to add new components using different languages.
* ROS
- "Robotic Operating System"
- Protocol for arbitrary message transmission between =rosnode='s.
- Allows communication across languages.
- =rosjava= is the Java interface to ROS.
* UIMA
- "Unstructured Information Management Architecture"
- Pipeline architecture used for information processing.
- Notably used (and significantly improved) in the IBM Watson
  project.
- Primarily written in Java.
  + Support for other languages, such as C++ exist, but appear to be
    deprecated.
** Common Analysis System (CAS)
- "Universal" datatype used by all components of UIMA.
- Holds some base information with various annotations written on top
  of it.
- This base information may be either plain document text or arbitrary
  binary data.
** Annotators
- Central component in UIMA.
- Inputs a CAS object, and adds new annotation objects to it.
- Defined by XML Descriptor file.
- Classes representing annotation types are auto-generated by UIMA.
** Basic Annotator Example
#+BEGIN_SRC java
  public class MyAnnotator extends JCasAnnotator_ImplBase {
      @Override
      public void process(JCas cas) throws AnalysisEngineProcessException {
          String docText = cas.getDocumentText();
          int location;
          if ((location = docText.indexOf("purple")) != -1) {
              Color color = new Color(cas);
              color.setBegin(location);
              color.setEnd(location + "purple".length());
              color.setColorName("purple");
              color.addToIndexes(cas);
          }
      }
  }
#+END_SRC
** Aggregate AE's
- Allows for chaining multiple annotators together.
- Essentially just an XML Descriptor file that orders other XML
  Descriptors.
* RoboSherlock
- Another project working to marry ROS with UIMA.
- Written entirely in C++.
  + As such, it uses the seemingly unsupported C++ UIMA.
  + While UIMA C++ supports other languages (including Python), that
    support is even more out-of-date than the core C++.
- We did take lessons learned from their pipeline design into
  consideration when outlining how ours would function.
* Networked UIMA
- Our design for making UIMA multi-lingual.
- Currently implemented using HTTP.
- Could be feasible over different protocols in the future.
** HTTP UIMA Protocol Description
- Serialize CAS object into JSON using built-in UIMA functions.
- Send Multipart HTTP request to an external server with the JSON-CAS
  and any necessary binary data.
- External annotator (acting as a server) receives the request,
  processes it, and returns a list of annotations in JSON.
** Returned Annotation JSON

          }
      ]
  }
#+END_SRC
** Configuration
- External annotators will have their access defined in a global JSON
  file, either distributed ahead of time or on some server at a fixed
  location.

#+RESULTS:
[[file:architecture.png]]
* Example Use Case
- We're going to add an example external annotator written in Python.
- There is an existing HTTP Annotator superclass in Python, so we
  don't need to worry about implementing the protocol.
- We'll be adding an annotator that find bits of text which refer to
  colors.
** Writing the Descriptor File
- An Eclipse plugin features a convenient GUI for working with XML
  Descriptor files.
- One will need only to specify the input types, the output types, and
  which Java class represents this descriptor.
[[./descriptor_editor.png]]
** Adding to the Aggregate AE
- Edit whatever Aggregate AE's Descriptor XML file you wish to add the
  Annotator to.
- Again, the Eclipse plugin makes this very easy to accomplish.
[[./aggregate_editor.png]]
** Writing the Java Code
- Goal to necessitate as little Java code as possible when writing an
  external annotator.
- Superclass takes care of all the custom protocol, so the concrete
  Annotator class has little to no code.
#+BEGIN_SRC java
  public class ColorsAnnotator extends HttpAnnotator { }
#+END_SRC
- Superclass auto-magically parses primitives into Annotations.
- Subclass can always override method to implement custom behavior.
** Writing the Python Annotation
- UIMA auto-generates the Annotation classes for Java, but we have to
  do so manually in other languages.
- The two types must agree in terms of field names and types, as well
  as the name of the Annotation itself.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  class Color(Annotation):
      def __init__(self, color, start, end):
          self.color = color
          self.begin = start
          self.end = end
#+END_SRC
** Writing the Python Annotator
- There's an existing implementation of our protocol in Python, so we
  simply extend it.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  class ColorAnnotator(Annotator):
      def initialize(self):
          super().initialize()
          self.color_words = ['red', 'blue', 'yellow']
          self.annotation_types.append(Color)

      def process(self, data):
          sofa_string = data['_referenced_fss']['1']['sofaString']
          for word in self.color_words:
              if word in sofa_string:
                  self.add_annotation(Color(word, -1, -1))
#+END_SRC
** Additional Configuration
- Add a new entry into the global configuration JSON file that lists
  the address and port this external annotator can be located.
** Running
- Document text to be analyzed is hard-coded into =Controller= for
  demonstration purposes.
